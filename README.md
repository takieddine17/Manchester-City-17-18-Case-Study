## 🔗 Sources

Stats were collected from www.fbref.com and collected into tables I created. The raw data was collected and combined by taking each teams season stats along with additional advanced stats for the modern teams. 

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

A limitation of this project was that due to deficiencies in the way stats were recorded pre-2010, most of the teams I looked at did not contain all of the advanced stats that we have in the modern game today. The only teams with complete stats are Manchester City 2017/18, Manchester City 2022/23 and Liverpool 2019/20.
